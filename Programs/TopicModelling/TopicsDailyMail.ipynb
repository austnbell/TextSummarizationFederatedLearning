profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the \\' first genocide of the 20th century\\n\\' he further proclaimed that \\' concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it\\n\\' ties that bind : the kim kardashian family tree that traces back to two armenian families home : kim kardashian \\'s ancient ancestors fled the armenian village karakale ( pictured recently ) to escape a prophecised genocide that did come to pass genocide : the village of karakale ( pictured in the 19th century ) was among hundreds destroyed as the ottoman turks laid waste to the region\\nresidents - possibly including the kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses disputed : armenian lands ( in red ) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th century , with bloody consequences armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman turks was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide\\nturkish rejects the claims , arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 armenians and as many ottoman turks died in civil strife when armenians rose up against their ottoman turks rulers and sided with invading russian troops\\nthe fundamental division was religious\\narmenians are christians , while ottoman turks are muslim\\nthe two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years , but the ottoman turks ottoman turks had always been on top\\nas ottoman turks rule crumbled , rival nationalisms arose , and the russian empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded\\narmenians say they were forced from their homes , marched to mass graves and slaughtered\\nsome managed to flee south into modern - day syria and the levant , others to russian - held land which is now modern - day armenia\\nhundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled\\nthe outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed\\nbut the use of the word \\' genocide \\' is hugely controversial , as turkey - successor to the ottoman turks empire , and with a huge majority of muslim ethnic ottoman turks - rejects the description\\narmenia , which became a fully - fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the soviet union , has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths\\nits modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred\\nthe province of kars ( above ) , where the kardashians \\' roots - and the origin of their name - lies , is almost entirely in turkish\\nits capital , kars , is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries : it sits on the border but the frontier is closed .'\n"
