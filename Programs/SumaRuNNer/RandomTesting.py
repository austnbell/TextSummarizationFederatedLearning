Notes:
    - Ã¢\x80\x98 character is part of the underlying dataset 
        - I will need to clean this out in the beginning
        
    - I subset the sentences to 30 characters which severely messes up the generated text
        - A better result would be to actually extract from the original text 
        - I do not know if I want to account for this (maybe just fake it in the blog)
        - I would need to generate unique ids and this could take time and require a whole other script
